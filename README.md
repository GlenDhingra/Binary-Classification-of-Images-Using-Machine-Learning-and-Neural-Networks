# Binary Classification of Images using Neural Networks

![Project Image](/Images/image1.jgp)

## Project Overview

The presented project implements binary classification of images using neural networks. In this project, a 4-layered Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model is implemented. The first three layers utilize ReLU activation functions, while the final decisive layer uses a Sigmoid activation function. We perform a total of 2400 iterations for learning.

## Key Features

- **4-Layer CNN Model:** Our project features a 4-layered CNN model designed for image classification.

- **Activation Functions:** ReLU activation functions are used on the first three layers, and a Sigmoid activation function is used on the final layer for binary classification.

- **Forward Propagation:** Outputs (weights and biases) at each layer are computed using linear regression during forward propagation and stored in cache.

- **Backward Propagation:** We utilize backward propagation to update the weights based on the computed loss and the stored cache data.
